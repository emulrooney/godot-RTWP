# godot-RTWP
*Incredibly unfinished* realtime with pause RPG in Godot

Attempt to replicate mechanics/control scheme from _Baldur's Gate_, _Pillars of Eternity_ and other real-time with pause RPGs. Future development is likely to involve 
a from-scratch reimplementation of the selection/movement mechanics, building a turn-based combat engine and then stealing things like the GUI, party system and ability system from this project.
